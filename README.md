# MEAL PLANNER

### **OVERVIEW**

This project aims to develop the *Meal Planner*, an application designed to simplify and personalize meal planning, providing a customized meal plan based on dietary preferences and nutritional goals, enabling an easier path to eating tailored to your objectives. The application has been designed for cloud deployment, utilizing *Docker* for containerization, *AWS EC2* to provide scalable and on-demand computational power, and *Amazon ECR* for storing and managing *Docker* images. This ensures optimized, scalable, and reliable performance in the cloud.

### **MAIN FEATURES**

 - **Customization**: The application allows for the adjustment of meal plans, which can be weekly or daily, adopting any specific diet such as Omnivore, Pescetarian, Vegetarian, Ovo-Vegetarian, Lacto-Vegetarian, or Vegan, in addition to the possibility of limiting the number of daily calories.

 - **Convenience**: Specific information can be checked, such as the price of ingredients in the recipe or how sweet, salty, and spicy it is, for example.

 - **Practicality**: Details about the recipe are easily accessible, such as required ingredients, preparation time, number of servings, and a brief summary of the recipe.

 - **Cloud Integration**: The combination used offers an efficient application through on-demand computing from AWS EC2, a secure repository for Docker image manipulation with AWS ECR, and encapsulation in containers provided by Docker, ensuring more agility and ease in the execution and testing of the system.
